# Eye-Rotation Project
This Project has two eyes which follow the mouse movement. Both the eyes are synchronised to follow the directions of the mouse pointer. It looks like a person following the mouse. The mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. Mouse events are a popular way to bind the DOM elements to events.

### Steps to Run the Project
Move the mouse to observe the rotation of the eye.

### Future Improvements
This Project can be further enhanced by adding reactions related to facial reaction
